    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      In the ever-evolving and thriving industry of Information and Technology,
      I have adopted skills and knowledge that will help me adapt in various
      kinds of environments. While still a hatchling, I work diligently with
      much resilience, keeping in mind the things I need to gain and sacrifice
      to excel in the industry. As a student and as an aspiring web and software
      developer, I hope to grow and learn more about myself and about what I can
      do. I hope to create opportunities that will help me thrive in my career
      and in my life.
