    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>
      User-centric solutions are the buzz in our day and age, paving the way for
      new development frameworks and project management strategies. Existing
      companies and start-ups alike adopt iterative processses to provide
      innovative and accurate solutions to users.

      The time I have spent as junior web developer got me through opportunities
      to create user-centric solutions that effectively and accurately solve the
      problems and goals of our intended users. Through our effective and
      interactive solutions, our clients received much value. Additionally, with
      my skills and knowledge of networking and data transmission, I was capable
      of increasing the efficiency and speed at which our solutions reached our
      customers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the short time I was in the workforce, I was able to learn the value of
      collaboration between multiple persons, especially those outside the
      development team, namely our clients, project manager, and resource
      manager. Despite the obstacles, our ambition and love for creating a
      product and solution in which our customers can find value pushed me and
      those I worked with to our limits, ensuring even the little details are
      impeccable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely<br />
      Jan Krishna<br />
